== Description ==

The Sales Trends for WooCommerce plugin adds a column to the WooCommerce Products list that indicates the percentage increase or decrease in sales quantity of each product during the current period compared to the previous period. Color-coded arrows make it easy to see the sales trend at a glance, and clicking them opens the built-in Sales by Product report for that product and the periods being compared. Sales period length is one week by default and can be changed by specifying any length in days.
